## Meeting Finder 


# User Story
As a user I would like to locate AA meetings so that I can continue in the process of recovery.

# Concept
An AA meeting locator that allows users to find meetings based on search criteria. Users are given the option to sign in or login as guest.  Upon login, users can save searched meetings, view meeting history, and check-in to meetings.
