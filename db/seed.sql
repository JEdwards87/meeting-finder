When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation "some fact of my life" unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment.',
    'I have come to believe that hard times are not just meaningless suffering and that something good might turn up at any moment. Thats a big change for someone who used to come to in the morning feeling sentenced to another day of life. When I wake up today, there are lots of possibilities. I can hardly wait to see whats going to happen next.',
    'First of all, we had to quit playing God. It didnt work.',
    'The feeling of having shared in a common peril is one element in the powerful cement which binds us.',
    'There is an island of opportunity in the middle of every difficulty.',
    'We should be sensible, tactful, considerate and humble without being servile or scraping. As Gods people we stand on our feet; we dont crawl before anyone.',
    'If we were to live, we had to be free of anger.',
    'To be vital, faith must be accompanied by self sacrifice and unselfish, constructive action.',

    'It is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed, no matter what the cause, there is something wrong with us.',
    'Avoid then, the deliberate manufacture of misery, but if trouble comes, cheerfully capitalize it as an opportunity to demonstrate His omnipotence.',
    'Ive been benefited from a dictionary definition I found that reads: "Rationalization is giving a socially acceptable reason for socially unacceptable behavior, and socially unacceptable behavior is a form of insanity.',
    'Almost none of us liked the self-searching, the leveling of our pride, the confession of shortcomings which the process requires for its successful consummation.',
    'They sound like the philosophy of a man who, having a headache, beats himself on the head with a hammer so that he cannot feel the ache.',
    'Through the years I had quit on everything that ever mattered: college, going for promotions, relationships - at least the relationships that demanded any work.',
    'How did people have conversations anyway? How did they meet and then begin to talk as if they had known each other for years?',
    'If we still cling to something we will not let go, we ask God to help us be willing.',
    'Identifying, they said, was trying to see how I was like the people I was with. Comparing, they told me, was looking for differences, usually seeing how I was better than others.'
